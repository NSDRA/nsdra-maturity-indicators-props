IDENTIFIER=MI-R1.3-88b52fa7b8-PARTICLE_SIZE_MEASURE
IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if the primary particle "statistical measure" is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The primary particle statistical measure is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Metadata Stewardship in Nanosafety Research: Community-Driven Organization of Metadata Schemas to Support FAIR NanoScience Data\n\
**REF:** https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10102033
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the primary particle statistical measure is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED= This is one of the nano particle's (NP) agglomeration-related metadata relevant for delivered dose (DD)\n\
assessment as a means to facilitate correct interpretation of in vitro bioassays and support data reuse (case study value: Mean Â± Stdev).
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name                             | Alternative terms                                                               |\n\
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\
| primary particle statistical measure   | primary-particle-statistical-measure,<br>primary_particle_statistical_measure   |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "primary particle statistical measure" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "primary particle statistical measure" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
