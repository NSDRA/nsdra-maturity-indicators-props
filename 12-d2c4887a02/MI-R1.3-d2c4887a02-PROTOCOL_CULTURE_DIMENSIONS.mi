IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if the "culture dimensions" is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The culture dimensions is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Minimum information reporting in bioâ€“nano experimental literature\n\
**REF:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-018-0246-4
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the culture dimensions is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED=The dimensions of the cell culture \
used are a determining factor of the effective cellular dose. If \
using a standard two-dimensional culture plate, providing details of \
the type of plate (for example, 24-well and supplier) and volume of \
media added is sufficient. For more complex systems (for example, \
three-dimensional spheroid models), full dimensions (for example, \
shape, height, width, depth) of the culture should be provided. If a \
non-standard orientation (for example, cells facing downward into \
media solution) or flow conditions is used, full details of how the \
condition is achieved should be provided.
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name          | Alternative terms                             |\n\
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n\
| culture dimensions  | culture-dimensions,<br>culture_dimensions     |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "culture dimensions" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "culture dimensions" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
