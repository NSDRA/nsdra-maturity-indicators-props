This MI is to indicate if the nanomaterial "size dispersity and aggregation" is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The nanomaterial size dispersity and aggregation is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Minimum information reporting in bioâ€“nano experimental literature\n\
**REF:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-018-0246-4
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the nanomaterial size dispersity and aggregation is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not. Representative unit: dispersity index.
WHY_MEASURED=Size dispersity and aggregation. Minimizing size dispersity and \
aggregation are central challenges in the preparation of colloidal \
dispersions of nanomaterials. Reporting the average size is insufficient \
to evaluate biological responses: consider the difference \
between particles with a uniform distribution in size from 10 to \
990 nm versus those that range from 495 to 505 nm. Both systems \
have an average size of 500 nm, but are likely to exhibit very \
different biological interactions. Thus, including characterization \
information on the size dispersity of engineered particles is vital. \
Details on how size dispersity was assessed, including concentration \
of the material investigated, protocol used and any preparatory \
steps, such as filtering, should be included. The fluid used \
to assess size dispersity should also be detailed, as biologically \
relevant media can induce agglomeration. If interpreting light \
scattering data, whether number-, intensity- or volume-based distributions \
are used should be specified.
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name                          | Alternative terms                                                       |\n\
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\
| size dispersity and aggregation     | size_dispersity_and_aggregation,<br>size-dispersity-and-aggregation     |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "size dispersity and aggregation" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "size dispersity and aggregation" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
