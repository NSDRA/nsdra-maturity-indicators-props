IDENTIFIER=MI-R1.3-d2c4887a02-PROTOCOL_IMAGING_DETAILS
IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if the "imaging details" is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The imaging details is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Minimum information reporting in bioâ€“nano experimental literature\n\
**REF:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-018-0246-4
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the imaging details is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED=For experiments involving imaging, details of how \
the imaging was conducted should be provided. In vivo, details of \
any shielding that was performed (for example, using aluminium \
foil to obscure injection point) should be included. Additionally, if \
a contrast agent was used, details of its administration (for example, \
concentration, method) should be provided. In culture, any \
image processing that is not applied uniformly to the entire image \
(for example, to highlight specific regions or features) should be \
explained, details of thresholding should be provided, and an image \
intensity scale should be included.
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name       | Alternative terms                    |\n\
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n\
| imaging details  | imaging-details,<br>imaging_details  |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "imaging details" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "imaging details" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
