IDENTIFIER=MI-R1.3-d2c4887a02-BIO_BIOLOGICAL_MODEL_JUSTIFICATION
IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if the "biological model justification" is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The biological model justification is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Minimum information reporting in bioâ€“nano experimental literature\n\
**REF:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-018-0246-4
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the biological model justification is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED=The choice of animal or cell \
model is a key factor in biological experimentation often reflecting a \
delicate balance between relevance, cost, availability and laboratory \
experience. Researchers should bear in mind that a model should \
be chosen to clearly present a biological scenario for addressing the \
intended research question rather than to produce the most exciting \
data70. Considering this, the choice of model should be justified.
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name                      | Alternative terms                                                     |\n\
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\
| biological model justification  | biological-model-justification,<br>biological_model_justification     |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "biological model justification" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "biological model justification" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
