IDENTIFIER=MI-R1.3-d2c4887a02-BIO_BACKGROUND_SIGNAL
IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if the "cell/tissue background signal" is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The cell/tissue background signal is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Minimum information reporting in bioâ€“nano experimental literature\n\
**REF:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-018-0246-4
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the cell/tissue background signal is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED=The background signal in the absence of particles, using whichever signalling modality \
to detect particles, should be quantified and reported. This is an \
important, often neglected, control that is essential for quantitative \
analysis across a variety of modalities (for example, flow cytometry, \
microscopy or magnetic resonance imaging).
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name         | Alternative terms                        |\n\
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |\n\
| background signal  | background-signal,<br>background_signal  |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "background signal" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "background signal" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
