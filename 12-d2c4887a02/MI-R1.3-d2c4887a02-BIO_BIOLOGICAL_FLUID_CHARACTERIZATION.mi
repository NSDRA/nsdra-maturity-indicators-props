IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if the "biological fluid characterization" is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The biological fluid characterization is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Minimum information reporting in bioâ€“nano experimental literature\n\
**REF:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-018-0246-4
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the biological fluid characterization is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED=The biomolecules that adhere \
to a nanomaterial on contact with a biological fluid substantially \
alter key particle properties. Thus, there has been substantial \
research into the formation of 'protein coronas' around particles, \
and how these coronas influence biological response. For culture \
media, type and percentage of serum added, if any, should be \
included. Information on media and serum should include ordering \
and batch details, species of origin, and details of additives (for \
example, antibiotics) or stabilizing agents. When investigating the \
effects of biological fluids, it is essential to subject the fluid to the \
same degree of characterization as the nanomaterial/fluid. For \
instance, if a nanoparticle is incubated with serum and relative \
concentrations of protein adsorbed onto the particle are reported, \
relative concentrations of proteins in bare serum should also be \
reported. Alternatively, if a fluid has established reference values \
for protein composition, cell presence and so on, these references \
can be specified. Unless the characterization of biological fluids is \
conducted, it is difficult (if not impossible) to determine whether \
differences in nanomaterial response are due to their properties or \
to biological variation.
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name                         | Alternative terms                                                        |\n\
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n\
| biological fluid characterization  | biological-fluid-characterization,<br>biological_fluid_characterization  |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "biological fluid characterization" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "biological fluid characterization" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
