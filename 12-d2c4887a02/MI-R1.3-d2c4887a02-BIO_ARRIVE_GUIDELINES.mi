IDENTIFIER=MI-R1.3-d2c4887a02-BIO_ARRIVE_GUIDELINES
IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if the "ARRIVE guidelines" adoption is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The ARRIVE guidelines adoption is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Minimum information reporting in bioâ€“nano experimental literature\n\
**REF:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-018-0246-4
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the ARRIVE guidelines adoption is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED=For in vivo experiments, the Animals \
in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines \
should be followed. ARRIVE is a 20-point checklist for reporting in \
vivo experiments, and includes details about species, strain, housing \
and ethical approval.
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name         | Alternative terms                        |\n\
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |\n\
| ARRIVE guidelines  | ARRIVE-guidelines,<br>ARRIVE_guidelines  |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "ARRIVE guidelines" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "ARRIVE guidelines" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
