# FAIR Maturity Indicators for NanoSafety Data Reusability (defined using Java properties files)
FAIR maturity indicators for nano-related datasets/databases/models

This repository aims at providing maturity indicators (MI) to assess the FAIRness of datasets/models/experiments related to the NanoToxicology domain for risk assessment applications.

The Maturity indicators are defined using Java properties files which are simple key/value pairs format files where each line is a key/value pair split by equal sign "=".

This repository is supposed to be used with the [FAIR Maturity Indicators **Generator** for NanoSafety Data Reusability](https://github.com/NSDRA/nsdra-maturity-indicators-generator)
