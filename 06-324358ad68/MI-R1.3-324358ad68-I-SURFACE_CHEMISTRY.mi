IDENTIFIER=MI-R1.3-324358ad68-I-SURFACE_CHEMISTRY
IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if "surface chemistry" information is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The surface chemistry information is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Best practice in reporting corona studies: minimum information about Nanomaterial Biocorona Experiments (MINBE)\n\
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2019.06.004
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the surface chemistry information is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED=Surface chemistry are important to report for corona characterization and\n\
to maximize the ability cross-comparison with other reported studies. Information to report:\n\
Zeta-potential, surface ligand characterization.
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name            | Alternative terms                        |\n\
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n\
| surface chemistry     | surface-chemistry,<br>surface-chemistry  |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "surface chemistry" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "surface chemistry" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
