IDENTIFIER=MI-R1.3-1fb3ef13d0-PCHEM-SURFACE_CHEMISTRY
IDENTIFIER_DESC=This maturity indicator falls under the FAIR principle R1.3:\n\
(meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\
\n\
The ID of this MI is composed of the following segments (separated by hyphen):\n\
1. Acronym for "Maturity Indicator"\n\
1. The FAIR principle this maturity indicator belongs to\n\
1. The first 10 characters truncated from the SHA-256 hash of the primary reference DOI of this maturity indicator.\n\
1. A short name to distinguish the maturity indicator definition file\n\
\n\
This MI is to indicate if "surface chemistry" is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
NAME=The surface chemistry is reported by the nano toxicity study
NAME_DESC= This maturity indicator is extracted from the following paper \n\
**Title:** Nanotechnologies â€” Guidance on physio-chemical characterization of engineered Nano scale materials for toxicological assessment\n\
**REF:** ISO/TR13014
WHICH_PRINCIPLE=R1.3
WHAT_MEASURED=If the surface chemistry is reported by the nano toxicity study data or not.
WHY_MEASURED=
WHAT_MUST_PROVIDED=If the value is measured and reported in the data, the following field(s) should appear in JSON-LD metadata: \n\
\n\
| Field Name           | Alternative terms                           |\n\
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n\
| surface chemistry    | surface-chemistry,<br>surface_chemistry     |
HOW_MEASUREMENT_EXECUTED=The "surface chemistry" should be provided in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD) which can be queried using open universal protocol like HTTP.
WHAT_CONSIDERED_VALID_RESULTS=The presence of the field "surface chemistry" in the JSON-LD metadata means the measurement is reported which is the valid result.
FOR_WHICH_DIGITAL_RESOURCE=For nano toxicity related datasets.
